# yaml-provenance integration

# Every value loaded from a YAML file becomes a ``WithProvenance`` subclass of
# its native type (str, int, …).  This means any downstream code can inspect
# *which* file, line and column a value originated from without any changes to
# the rest of Autosubmit.
#
# Enable full provenance history so merges across multiple YAML files preserve
# a complete chain of origin information.
