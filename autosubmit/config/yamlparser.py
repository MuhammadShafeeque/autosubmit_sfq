# YAML file becomes a ``WithProvenance`` subclass of its native type (str, int,
# …).  This means any downstream code can inspect *which* file, line and column
# a value originated from without any changes to the rest of Autosubmit.
#
# Install (from the feature branch until merged to main):
#   pip install "yaml-provenance @ git+https://github.com/esm-tools/yaml-provenance.git@feat/yaml_dumper"
#
# If the library is not installed, loading falls back silently to the standard
# ruamel.yaml behaviour so nothing breaks.

# Pickle compatibility for WithProvenance types
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# yaml-provenance creates wrapper classes dynamically at runtime via
# ``type(class_name, (base_type,), {...})``.  The classes are stored only in
# ``_wrapper_registry`` — they are *never* added as attributes of the
# ``yaml_provenance._wrapper`` module.  Pickle, however, serialises a class
# by recording its module + qualified name and then performing an attribute
# lookup on that module at restore time:
#
#     yaml_provenance._wrapper.StrWithProvenance   →   AttributeError
#
# This causes ``_pickle.PicklingError`` when Autosubmit tries to persist the
# job list (``job_list_persistence.py``, line 130).
#
# Fix: inject a ``__reduce__`` method into every WithProvenance class so that
# pickle serialises each instance as its plain builtin base type (str, int,
# float, bool …).  Provenance metadata is intentionally dropped during pickle
# — it is only used in-process for diagnostics, not for job execution.
#
# The function must be called *after every* ``load_yaml()`` invocation because
# the registry is populated lazily: new entry types (e.g.
# ``ScalarIntWithProvenance``, ``ScalarFloatWithProvenance``) are added the
# first time a value of that type is encountered.  Re-patching is idempotent.
